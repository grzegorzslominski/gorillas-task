To run the project you need to:

1. Run the 'npm i' command in the terminal
2. Run the "npm start" command in the console
3. Navigate to the local server url displayed by the terminal.

Problems encountered:

1. No acceptance of shadows by shader-based material.
2. No influence of directional light on material made based on the shader.
3. No refraction of the image behind the object made based on the shader.

I have tried to solve the above problems, but without much success.
